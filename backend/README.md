# Backend (Supabase)

This directory is reserved for Supabase configuration, migrations, and edge functions.
Since we are using Supabase Cloud, the "backend" logic primarily resides in your Supabase project dashboard.

However, you can perform local development by running:
`npx supabase init`

This will generate a `supabase` directory here with `config.toml`.
